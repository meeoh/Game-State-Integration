# Game-State-Integration

This project is for users to be able to communicate their current status of a counter strike/dota game to others via an express server that receives postcalls from the game-state-integration features recently implemented by valve. This is meant for people to communicate to the rest of their family whetther or not they are in a game, and approximately how long it will take to finish.

Features include:
- percentage complete
- time spent in game
- current round
- request button (request to not start another game/come upstairs)
- plays whip noise on won round and fart noise on lost round

##Usage
Run npm install<br>
Run node server.js<br>
Go to ip of host port 3000
